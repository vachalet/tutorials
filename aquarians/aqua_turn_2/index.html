  <h1>Aquarians: Runde 2</h1>

  <h1>Turn 2</h1>
<p>First boat sent<br>
All mages are T1</p>
<p><img src="./f373cd4b07611027d143a7e96a48ea406833fdf0.png" alt="Map turn 2" title="Map turn 2" integrity="sha1-f373cd4b07611027d143a7e96a48ea406833fdf0"></p>
<p>Everything went as planned except for one entertainer unit that didn't leave the boat. I forgot the LEAVE order!<br>
No major consequences, it's an opportunity that will need to be exploited.<br>
No visits from potential neighbors.<br>
No coasts on the horizon.</p>
<p>The turn is simple, we have no more silvers to spend:<br>
Everyone who can brings back money, the boat explores, we start building the second boat. The future captain learns entertain, it can always be useful.</p>
<h2>Mages</h2>
<p>ALL mages will cast a spell to earn money.<br>
In Gwryrrd it's Cattle Healing<br>
ATTENTION: Make sure to get into the habit of setting the spell level. Otherwise it's a cast at the mage's level.<br>
<strong>CAST LEVEL 1 "Cattle Healing"</strong><br>
Some will tell you to be cautious. That's wise, but we don't yet have the means to be.<br>
<em>Each mage has a 20% fumble risk.</em></p>
