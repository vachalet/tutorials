  <h1>Turn 6 (29/10 4/11)</h1>
<hr>
<p>A third boat is launched!<br>
Not enough wood to build a new boat.</p>

<p>No visits from potential neighbors.<br>
No coasts on the horizon!</p>
<h2>Sygirfal</h2>
<p>470 silver on Sygirfal<br>
We will spend 400 to recruit 5 new entertainers.<br>
Hammon (4qmp) reached level 3, we will take advantage to teach entertainment to the new ones and to level 1 entertainers.
The LEARN AUTO skill order for the teacher and students, allows leaving the program to optimize the LEARN and TEACH of the skill.</p>
<p>Not having enough wood anymore, Ugarit (4qmj) learns to make carts.<br>
Zimrida (hha6) waits for a second horse and entertainment. The 2 horses will allow him to pull the Halfling's cart if he entrusts it to us.<br>
Plus we'll be a bit tight on silver, so an extra entertainer isn't bad.</p>
<p>The boats explore, those who can bring back money do so.</p>
<h2>Diplomacy</h2>
<p>Nothing special, and just like in real life, I don't have much time, so I neglect maintaining relations and set that aside.<br>
As it turns out, I'll miss a message about a collaboration proposal, which will have consequences.</p>
<h2>Magellan</h2>
<p>New tip : how to distinguish between what you can actually see and all the regions what you discovered.
In Magellan Right click on the Map then Renderer / Region Renderer / Enable fog of war</p>
