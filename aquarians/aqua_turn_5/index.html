  <h1>Turn 5</h1>
<hr>
<p><em>Diplomatic messages are in communication</em></p>
<p>No visits from potential neighbors.<br>
<strong>Discovery of close neighbors!</strong><br>
<strong>Meeting with a tribe from the new island!</strong></p>

<h2>Vesolsinmul</h2>
<p><img src="./3f43579c2be96f97db51515138e08cb1a828463a.png" alt="Linge Home Region" title="Vesolsinmul" integrity="sha1-3f43579c2be96f97db51515138e08cb1a828463a"></p>
<p>The boat that left west directly landed on the plain of Vesolsinmul. This is the starting region of the Halbe Linge, a halfling tribe.<br>
This race is a real money-making machine. It would be good to befriend them otherwise we're going to be in competition.<br>
Sending a message to the Halbe Linge.<br>
They haven't cut wood yet, their forest is at 500.<br>
The Ling unit carries the halflings' starting allocation.<br>
With diplomacy being positive, we decide to continue our voyage without leaving an ambassador.<br>
We continue west, but be careful, a boat can only depart from the coast it landed on or those directly to the right or left.<br>
Since we arrived from the southeast, we must leave either by the southwest or by the east.<br>
The southwest being land, we leave by the east.</p>
<h2>Gogan Ror</h2>
<p><img src="./f3eec948d5fb527f23f3d54c475eeeaeb7519be9.png" alt="Anbeter Home Region" title="Gogan Ror" integrity="sha1-f3eec948d5fb527f23f3d54c475eeeaeb7519be9"></p>
<p>Our swimmer meets the Anbeter des Großen Baums, a human tribe. There is 1 castle at 10 (humans' basic allocation), and 2 potions.<br>
It's a bit early for potion making so these must be "pot of toadslime" or potions given by another tribe.<br>
Let's note the ID of the units with potions, they might be the mages:<br>
Erzdruidin Milli (ii), Erzdruide Boros (drui),<br>
The human has started making weapons (spear) and used their starting wood. No horses yet. Humans are those who can best compete with aquarians in navigation.<br>
Let's try to make them a friend or even an ally.<br>
Sending a message to the Anbeter des Großen Baums.<br>
Hannibal (4qmd) will entertain.</p>
<h2>Boats</h2>
<p>O mon Bateau!, our northeast boat, did coastal sailing and hugs the coasts of the new island.<br>
It will go further east and we'll try to get the island's map through diplomacy.<br>
We take the opportunity to rename this boat (just an idea :) ).</p>
<h2>Sygirfal</h2>
<p>We have 240 silvers.<br>
Jesibel (4qmf) failed her spell for 100 silvers!<br>
Izabel (4qme) is no longer a toad.<br>
Hyrum (z4v3) gained a level in perception!</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li>We need silver to send the boat to sea.<br>
We give Aqhat (t3zs) 90 silvers and Itthobaal (om0k) boards with 10 silvers and will entertain upon departure (+20 silvers = upkeep). Both enter the boat, Itthobaal gives control to the captain.<br>
We're going to leave southeast.<br>
Ugarit (4qmj) leaves the boat and finishes it.</li>
<li>We use 80 silvers to recruit a new entertainer and keep the rest in case things go wrong (mage fumbles).</li>
<li>We cut wood (T1 = 1 wood/week/h), tame horses (T1 = 1 horse/week/h).</li>
<li>The rider learns entertain while waiting for his horse. He will go to the Halbe Linge to strengthen ties.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Diplomacy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Halbe Linge: first contact goes well and I might be able to handle trade</li>
<li>Anbeter des Großen Baums: friendly, proposes trade.</li>
</ul>
