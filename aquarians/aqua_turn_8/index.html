  <h1>Aquarians: Runde 8</h1>
  <time datetime="2023-11-08T00:00:00.000Z">November 8, 2023</time>
  <h1>Turn 8</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>Found a new close neighbor!</strong><br>
This is the first turn where we can be attacked or robbed (assaulted)!<br>
No coasts on the horizon but the firewall!<br>
<strong>Crisis situation with neighbors</strong></p>

<p>No visits from potential neighbors.</p>
<h2>The Firewall</h2>
<p>The crew of the Gin Fizzzz (p1n2) refuses to travel to firewall (4, 15).<br>
Eressea is divided into multiple zones, commonly referred to as worlds.<br>
These zones are separated by borders.<br>
"Firewalls" typically serve as borders.<br>
Firewalls can't be crossed.</p>
<h2>Topares: meeting 2 neighbors, "Halbe Linge" and "Trolle, einige Steine tragend".</h2>
<p>Both could work together.
Sending a message to the troll. Interesting partner for an Aquarian (mining, quarrying, construction and solid front line)!</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>Zimrida (hha6) continues towards Vesolsinmul.
Bodmelqart (4qmc) will follow the firewall a bit.
Baldo (4qmk) will get closer to the north island coasts.
Aqhat (t3zs) will go back up to our island.</p>
<h2>Sygirfal</h2>
<p>720 silver on Sygirfal
We recruit a captain and start a new boat
The rest of the money is kept for next week.</p>
<h2>Diplomacy</h2>
<p>That week I send my orders early, I have little time and I receive late a warning from the Halfling!
He accuses me of hiding, that means moving with a stealthy unit (or in Hide faction)
He writes to me with copy to the troll and another tribe. That doesn't smell good! Does he want to make others believe I'm a spy?
I must absolutely defend myself quickly or it will become complicated!
Is there another faction trying to hide by pretending to be me? (a demon?)
I check well on the region if I don't see anything and if by chance I wouldn't have made an error.
None. No stealth. Is(are) he(they) looking for a pretext to harm me?
Anyway I can't do more, I can no longer modify my orders, the turn is launched in less than 4 hours and I don't have access to my computer or internet.
It's my fault. I should have taken time to communicate more with him and not taken a friendly first contact for granted. If this goes badly, it will be my fault.
When meeting a potential ally you really need to establish strong and regular contact.</p>
